# ATM Simulation Project

This project is a Java-based ATM simulation with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as:

*   Logging in with a card and PIN.
*   Checking account balance in multiple currencies (PLN, USD, EUR, CZK).
*   Withdrawing funds.
*   Depositing funds.
*   Changing PIN.
*   Currency exchange between available currencies.

## Technologies Used

*   Java
*   Swing (for GUI)
*   NBP API (for currency exchange rates)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

*   `src/`: Contains the Java source code.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Usage

To run the application:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred Java IDE).
3.  Build the project.
4.  Run the `Main.java` file.

## Notes

*   The currency exchange rates are fetched from the NBP API.
